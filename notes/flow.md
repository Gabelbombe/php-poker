Flow Basics
===========

I think the general flow is going to be something like this.

 * Player initializes the application, using return as existing user or add new user
 * Game rules are selected (existing can be preffed to last game rules type?)
 * Player is new, wallet is loaded 100c (?) or existing wallet is applied
 * ?? Should player select bot count or should bot count be random? (this is a session persistent thing until bots run out of $$$)
 *


Idea:

STATS Table; Game streak count, best hand save (by points?), total hands played, fav rule set, other shit....
